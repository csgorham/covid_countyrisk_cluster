County-level covid-19 risk will be anticipated using publicly available datasets. A machine learning predictive model of risk will be developed and trained to cluster counties as a function of similar risk. US Covid Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI), developed by Surgo Ventures (and CDC), will be used in conjunction with: CDC vaccination data, county-level GDP (US Dept. of Commerce) and “mask use by county” dataset available on Goolge Cloud’s BigQuery.

A third dataset will be tied in, detailing political-leaning in the 2020 US election, to produce a “new normal travel-agent app” that suggests low-risk counties (of desired political leaning) within specified driving distance. FourSquare API will recommend activities therein.
